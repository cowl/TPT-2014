Overall feedback: Intuitive solutions.
All I can say is that you passed an implicit
parameter in exercise 3 and made some explicit in
the LEQ exercise where it was not necessary.

Well done.

| Ex 1 | Ex 2 | Ex 3 | Ex 4 | Ex 5 | Ex 6 | Ex 7 | Ex 8 | Ex 9 | +1 | TOTAL      |
|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|----|------------|
| 1    | 1    | 1    | 1    | 0.75 | 0.75 | 1    | 0.25 | 0    | 1  | 7.75 -> 8  |


### Exercise 1                   
* OK

1

### Exercise 2                         
* OK
* Lots of helperfunctions, intuitive
1

### Exercise 3                       

* OK
* Didn't need to pass {n} to recursive call in plan

1

### Exercise 4                    

* OK

1

### Exercise 5                   

* No distributivity (-0.25)

0.75

### Exercise 6
* Antisym not entirely completed but since we round on 0.5's,
* granting 0.75 is simply more practical

0,75

### Exercise 7 (or 8, the LEQ one)

* OK
* Sometimes not essential need to make some implicit parameters explicit

1

### Exercise 8 (or 7)
* Got 2 right

0.25

### Exercise 9
* Not implemented
