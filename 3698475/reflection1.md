I could've definietly placed some more comments, I guess I just didn't 
think about it at the time.

I could've been more diligent when it comes to checking for useless cases,
A couple of times the model had compacter solutions where i had
redundant cases.

| Ex 1 | Ex 2 | Ex 3 | Ex 4 | Ex 5 | Ex 6 | Ex 7 | Ex 8 | Ex 9 | +1 | TOTAL |
|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|----|-------|
| 1    | 1    | 0.75 | 1    | 0.75 | 0.2  | 1    | 1    | 0.5  | 1  | 8.2   |


### Exercise 1                   
* OK

1

### Exercise 2                         
* OK
* solution is more compact, less cases
1

### Exercise 3                       

* did not finish correct (-0.25)

0.75

### Exercise 4                    

* OK
* Could've used constructors instead of numerical values and + function, 
* not sure which is 'better'.

1

### Exercise 5                   

* No distributivity (-0.25), considering the solution,
* I don't feel too bad for not finding it.
* Solution has less cases

0.75

### Exercise 6
* Didn't really get this one, only made SubListRefl (-0.8)

0,2

### Exercise 7 (or 8, the LEQ one)

* Seems solution is missing antisym
* OK

1

### Exercise 8 (or 7)
* Got about half

0.5

### Exercise 9
* Doesn't at all look like the solution,
* so I'm not sure if I should get any points here...
* I think I got the idea right where a variable is in scope
* when its index is smaller or equal to the depth it is,
* though I didn't use any smart datatypes.
* 0,5 it is.

0.5
